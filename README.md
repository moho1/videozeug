Skripte, die ich f√ºr die Video AG entwickle.

## cornerpin.py
cornerpin.py is a tool to apply the Adobe Premiere Pro Corner Pin
Effekt, but in a faster Way.

It gets the coordinates of the corners as argument, computes linear
functions between the corners and generates opencv.remap matrixes
to finally apply opencv remap.

By adding other function-generators, most of the code can be
re-used when implementing the straighten program or even more
complex mappings.

Currently, the Cornerpin result here differs a bit (too much) from
Premieres result. I am not sure weather it is my fault or premiere's.

## diff.py
diff.py is a tool, to read a video and generate a black/white-mask,
which fades, depending on motion in a part of the video.

If there is, for example, a motion (a person) in the left half of the
Image, then fade the mask to black with an offset of 50 frames and a
fading Time of 25 frames. If the motion is gone for at least 50 frames
fade the mask in again with the same settings.

In Adobe Premiere Pro, the mask can be set as the alpha-channel
using the "Set Matte"-Effekt.
